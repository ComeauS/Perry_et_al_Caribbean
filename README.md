Future projections of RAPmax under SLR: To explore the implications of the new derived RAPmax rates in relation to future projections of SLR and to examine implications for above-reef water depth increases under future warming scenarios we utilised published data on the response of coral and coralline algae calcification, and bioerosion from micro/macro-eroders to the combined effects of modifications of pH and temperature reported in the literature during laboratory experiments (see Cornwall et al. 2021 for more details). Linear regression analysis was used to estimate their responses to the combined effects of both ocean acidification and warming (see here code mPorportional_effects_Coral_CCA.R). Projection of proportional changes of coral and coralline algae calcification, and bioerosion from micro/macro eroders were made for each reefs following regional SSP projections of temperature and pH changes. These regional projections used temperature and pH data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6/) to create a multi-model annual mean for the historical hindcast and each of the four SSP future scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). The multi-model mean used all available climate model outputs to date for temperature (totalling 23, 22, 22, 19, 23 for historical, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, respectively) and pH (11 for all scenarios). Models were regridded to a regular grid, data for each site extracted from the nearest grid point, and finally averaged across models (see script xxx).
